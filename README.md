#  Drishti – AI-Powered Governance Intelligence Platform

**Drishti** is a full-stack web application designed to help citizens register grievances and enable authorities to track, analyze, and respond to issues efficiently.  
The project demonstrates a **modern governance-tech architecture** using a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

This repository contains **both frontend and backend** code in a single project structure for easy submission and evaluation.

##  Problem Statement

Government grievance systems often suffer from:
- Manual and delayed complaint handling
- Lack of transparency for citizens
- No easy way to track complaint status
- Poor data organization for analysis

**Drishti solves this by providing a digital, structured, and scalable grievance platform.**

---

## Solution Overview

Drishti allows users to:
- Log in using a simple username
- Register grievances under predefined categories
- Automatically generate a unique complaint ID
- Track the status of previously submitted complaints
- Store and retrieve data persistently using MongoDB

The system is built to be **scalable**, **clean**, and **future-ready for AI integration**.

##  Application Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. User opens the application
2. User logs in using a **username only**
3. Dashboard is displayed with options:
   - Register Grievance
   - Track Complaint
4. User submits a grievance with:
   - Category
   - Description
   - Address
5. Backend generates a **unique Complaint ID**
6. Complaint is stored in MongoDB
7. User can track complaint status anytime using the same username

  "address": "Ward 12",
  "status": "Submitted",
  "created_at": "2025-12-31T10:30:00"
}
